## 👋 Hi, I'm Siddhant 

I’m a backend engineer who enjoys building reliable systems and solving the kind of problems that require both logic and patience.  
Most of my work revolves around backend development, distributed workflows, and system-level tools.

---

## 💡 Good at 
- Writing clear, maintainable **system** for real-world problems.
- Designing **workflow engines, queues, and automation pipelines** that can survive edge cases.
- Working with **databases, caching, concurrency, and system-level behavior**.
- Thinking in **systems**: concurrency, locking, retries, scalability, and failure handling.

---

## 🚀 Currently exploring 
- Improving my understanding of **distributed systems & reliability patterns**.
- **High-performance backend engineering** — concurrency, async patterns, and optimizing I/O-heavy work.
- **Better engineering practices** — observability, testing strategies, CI/CD, and clean architecture.
