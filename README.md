## 👋 Hey, I'm Siddhant

I’m a backend engineer who loves breaking things, fixing them cleaner,  
and designing systems that don’t panic at 3 AM.  
Fun to work with, serious about architecture.

---

## ⚡ What I’m Really Good At (5 Points)
- Turning messy real-world problems into **clean, reliable backend systems**.
- Building **distributed workflows** with concurrency, locks, retries, and idempotency baked in.
- Writing **high-performance Python** that handles I/O, async, multiprocessing, and big workloads.
- Making infra behave: **Linux, Redis, Nginx/OpenResty, Docker, PM2**, debugging with logs > guesses.
- Thinking in **systems** — queues, state machines, backpressure, fault-tolerance, and scalability patterns.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Currently Exploring (3 Points)
- Designing tiny but powerful **system-level tools**: locks, caches, schedulers, metrics collectors.
- Improving my **systems design depth**: consistency models, distributed coordination, reliability patterns.
- Sharpening my **frontend (React/Next.js)** to build smoother dashboards & dev tools.
